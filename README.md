# OSR Console: Adventures in turn-based text

OSR Console is a turn-based dungeon crawler RPG in the Old-School Renaissance (OSR) style for your terminal. The game's main library, `osrlib`, is written in Python, as is its user interface which uses the [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) TUI framework.

## Project status

Character creation isn't quite in, and there are no monsters or spells or combat or anything fun like that. This isn't yet a game you can actually play; more like early-stage hackin' stuff together-type stuff.

ðŸ‘‰  = In progress

- [x] Build partial proof-of-concept in private repo.
- [x] Create public repo (this one).
- [x] Init `mkdocs` project (sans actual docs).
- [x] Move `osrlib`, `osrgame`, and `tests` projects to this repo.
- [x] Move to [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
- [ ] ðŸ‘‰ Character save/load in [TinyDB](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/).
- [ ] Party and character creation workflow in UI.
- [ ] ...and everything else you need for a turn-based dungeon crawler fantasty RPG.
