# OSR Console: Adventures in turn-based text

OSR Console is a turn-based dungeon crawler RPG in the Old-School Renaissance (OSR) style for your terminal. The game's main library, `osrlib`, is written in Python, as is its user interface which uses the [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) TUI framework.
